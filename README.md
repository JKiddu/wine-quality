# Wine Quality

## Description

Our aim was to determine variation in white and red wine using the variables alcohol, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, residual sugar, critic acid, chlorides, free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide, density, pH and sulphates and to facilitate comparison between the two wines taking these variables and the best models into consideration.

## Getting Started

For the analysis we have compared different models in order to determine which of the following models will be the best to predict the quality of wine and also which attributes are more significant than others.

1. Decision Tree
2. LASSO
3. Ridge
4. Multiple Regression
